# Cyber-Security-Verzeo-Internship
## Minor Project
### Overview:-
Modern websites use databases to store and manage information. We want to better understand the framework that
makes the connection between a webpage and a database possible. And will try to exploit the known vulnerability to
get access into database and find out more information.

#### Activity:-
• URL: https://lab.hackerinside.xyz/login.php

• Find out the vulnerability.

• exploit the vulnerability.

• grab the ‘flag’.

• HINT: it’s on a different table.

• Suggest a patch for this bug.



## Major Project
### Overview:-
Students will explore the security of e-mail, disposable email accounts and use a secure email
system.
### Purpose:-
Email is one of the most-used forms of communication. How secure are the systems that we use daily and what are
the implications of insecure systems?
We will also look at alternatives that would ensure security?
### Objectives:-
Identify security issues related to common email systems. Use a
disposable, temporary email system
Apply principles of secure email through the PGP email system.
### Explore:-
Temporary, Disposable E-Mail

Guerrilla Mail - https://www.guerrillamail.com/

Temp Mail - https://temp-mail.org/en/

Fake Inbox - http://www.fakeinbox.com/

Nada - https://getnada.com/

### Activity:-
Install and send a message using PGP - http://openpgp.org/

There are many options for using PGP, try different ones and see how they work together.
### Activity:-
